# TODO: workarea_cleaner
+ check why "020416__Balcony/.../dsc00908.jpg.pp3" isn't hidden
++ it's because its RAW original was already under Unmatched/ directory

+ check why 'D:/Photo/DualCam_Inp/280516__KishGlen/TRASH/2016-06-09_22-22-50__HideUnusedFiles__1/D_colon__slash_/Photo/Du
alCam_Inp/280516__KishGlen/Fixed/R' is created - why there's an absolute path
++ the bug is in ok_find_filepaths_common_prefix - investigate it

+ provide global settings dir in pair-matcher CLI - for locating unmatched settings files

+ what about simulate-only for hiding unmatched images AND their settings ?

+ support restoring settings of unmatched images

? support renaming and restoring names of settings files of matched images
?? QUESTIONABLE - the mainstream flow suggests renaming originals first

- check workarea for compliance before each action

- backup overriden settings files
- avoid per-file dir-s while backup overriden settings files

- HOWTO: refuse "unhide" if supplied dir is not a "backup"
-- for instance, require that it lies under the -backup_dir ?
-- better: always create a backup/hide indicator file by "hide" action; do pay attention at namerestoration action too
-- or better: detect allowed subdirectory names by action key

- rethink:   { set ::ok_utils::WORK_AREA_ROOT_DIR    "" ;   # OK for this use-case}
