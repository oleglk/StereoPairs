# TODO: workarea_cleaner
+ check why "020416__Balcony/.../dsc00908.jpg.pp3" isn't hidden
++ it's because its RAW original was already under Unmatched/ directory

+ check why 'D:/Photo/DualCam_Inp/280516__KishGlen/TRASH/2016-06-09_22-22-50__HideUnusedFiles__1/D_colon__slash_/Photo/Du
alCam_Inp/280516__KishGlen/Fixed/R' is created - why there's an absolute path
++ the bug is in ok_find_filepaths_common_prefix - investigate it

+ provide global settings dir in pair-matcher CLI - for locating unmatched settings files

+ what about simulate-only for hiding unmatched images AND their settings ?

+ support restoring settings of unmatched images

? support renaming and restoring names of settings files of matched images
?? QUESTIONABLE - the mainstream flow suggests renaming originals first

- check workarea for compliance before each action

+ backup overriden settings files
+ avoid per-file dir-s while backup overriden settings files

+ HOWTO: refuse "unhide" if supplied dir is not a "backup"
-- for instance, require that it lies under the -backup_dir ?
-- better: always create a backup/hide indicator file by "hide" action; do pay attention at namerestoration action too
++ or better: detect allowed subdirectory names by action key

- rethink:   { set ::ok_utils::WORK_AREA_ROOT_DIR    "" ;   # OK for this use-case}

+ compute WB diff for color comparator as R/G, G/B ratios

+ do not abort color comparison on presense of unmatched file(s)

+ add "common" section in preferences; should include "-INITIAL_WORK_DIR"

+ allow opening preferences window multiple times - "reset" button should not be created each time

+ text viewer for colol-comparator output

+ text viewer for help file

+?  distinguish between left-side and right-side IDs in workarea cleaner
-- pay attention to find_lr_image_ids_in_pair_namelist performing "lsort -unique"

- test input set with some equal ID(s) on the 2 sides

- hide renamed (only), e.g. dual-ID images with < 2 used IDs

+ options for pair-name flexibility

+ make textviewer expand correctly

- replace R,G,B color-comparison with total brightness (1 value instead of 3)

- print RAW color multipliers into color-comparison output - whenever RAWs are available; only print, do not use in sorting

- define and perform manual test sequence

+ elaborate the text of info/error/warning messages

- improve help file

- write an installation guide

- fix UI focus by TAB - it ignores option lines that are outside of the viewport

- test input set with different left/right RAW extensions (formats)

- test input set with different left/right std-image extensions (formats)

- let -left_img_subdir/-right_img_subdir conrol the names of subdirectories in all relevant utilities; currently it works for analyzer, while the pair-matcher has its left/right image subdirectory names hardcoded to "L"/"R"
