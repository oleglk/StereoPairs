Stereopair matcher
Functionality:
- Detect pairing of out-of-camera RAW or JPEG images using timestamps from EXIF; allow creation-time as backup
- Print list of matched out-of-camera images into a text file
- If requested, build SBS images
- If requested, rename/sort images to suit StereoPhotoMaker batch LR-images loading
- If requested, hide non-matched RAW or JPEG images
- Optionally utilize user-provided list of matched out-of-camera images
- It would be desirable to auto-align the pairs, but StereoPhotoMaker lacks command-line options

Inputs:
- Two directories with RAW or camera-JPEG files	- mandatory
- Two directories with RAW-processed standard image files (TIFF, JPEG, etc.)	- optional
- Time difference between two cameras	- optional; default=0
- Output directory	- mandatory even if creating SBS images not requested
- list of matched out-of-camera images	- optional; if given, skip time-based pair matching
- TODO: think about getting partial list of matches and extending it if possible
- Directory for hiding unmatched images	- optional

Switches:
-time_diff <VAL,?msec?>	: time difference between the 2nd and 1st cameras; default = 0
-create_sbs	: join matched pairs into SBS images; requires the two directories with standard images
-rename_lr	: rename left-right images to be recognizable by StereoPhotoMaker batch loading
(-align	: auto-align the resulting  SBS images)
-use_pairs_list <PATH>	: provides pre-built pair matches
-out_dir <PATH>	: output directory
-move_unmatched <PATH>	: directory to move unmatched inputs to; if not given, don't move those
-time_from <exif|create>	: source of shots' timestamps; default==exif - requires external tool (dcraw?)

The algorithm:
- If using exif as timestamp source, verify that dcraw is available; abort if missing
-? How to read exif from a JPEG; is it possible with dcraw?
- The main challenge: process bursts. These are badly synchronized, so try to find closest (time-wise) left/right
shots
- Use per-camera inter-frame time threshold to detect bursts: MAX_BURST_GAP
- Detect beginnings and ends of all the bursts in each sequence
- Match shots outside of burst ranges by taking closest peer shot within +-MAX_BURST_GAP
- Match each shot inside of burst range to one or two peers
-- one peer if it has smallest time-difference
-- two peers if their time-difference is equal
-- burst matching applies when and only when the candidate peers are inside burst range
- Save a text file with the matches:
-- A line per a match
--- 1 bidirectional line for single-shot match
--- 2 unidirectional lines instead of 1 bidirectional for bursts - for simplicity
-- Match-line format: {shot-L} (<)(>) {shot-R}
--- Match-line example - no burst: {dsc01} <> {dsc13}
--- Match-lines example - burst L>R1: {dsc01} > {dsc12}
--- Match-lines example - burst L>R2: {dsc01} > {dsc13}
--- Match-lines example - burst R>L1: {dsc01} < {dsc13}
--- Match-lines example - burst R>L1: {dsc02} < {dsc13}
- SBS creation relies on ImageMagic, not StereoPhotoMaker
- If SBS creation requested, make SBS images for all matches under the output directory
- If renaming of left-right images requested, do it
(-- If requested, auto-align the resulting  SBS images)
