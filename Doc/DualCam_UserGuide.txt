Software utilities to supplement dual-cam stereocamera.
===============================================

The "DualCam-companion" application facilitates workflow efficiency when postprocessing photos from dual-camera rigs. Its primary goal is preparing inputs for an existing stereo-photo editor. Using StereoPhotoMaker for most of the work is assumed and recommended, but not mandatory.

The application is comprised of several essentially independent utilities, each one usable on its own behalf. And there is a simplistic GUI front-end that provides:
- a set of buttons - a button to invoke each of the below utilities
- directory-choice dialog to choose the workarea directory
- a dialog to define the preferences

The utilities
==============
1) Stereopair matcher ("Rename Pairs" and "Restore Names" buttons)
Finds stereopairs among left- and right out-of-camera image sets. Builds text file with list of paired image names and renames image files to be recognized as left/right components by StereoPhotoMaker or a similar program.
2) Conversion settings copier ("Clone Settings" button)
Clones RAW converter settings files from left image to right or vice-versa.
3) Color comparator ("Compare Colors" button)
Compares color statistics between left and right peers and reports differences above a set threshold
4) Unused inputs cleaner ("Hide Unused" and "Unhide Unused" buttons)
Removes original files not used in ultimately built stereopairs.  May consider removing intermediate files too.
A better spec: removes from under the specified root directory all image- and converter-settings files whose IDs aren't included in the names of the ultimate stereopair images.

The workarea
============
The workarea for processing stereopairs is a disk directory under which all the involved files are placed. The structure of the workarea assumes subdirectories with predefined/configurable names for specific file types.
Reasonable flexibility is allowed through setting the "DualCam-companion" application preferences.
The simple example used by the author for camera-JPEG based workflow:
+<workarea-root-directory>/
+-L/	directory with left-side out-of-camera JPEG images
+-R/	directory with right-side out-of-camera JPEG images
+-Data/	directory for the application logs and data files

User Interface Principles
=========================
- Pressing a button of an utility first brings a dialogue/form with a line for each invocation option of the utility
- The initial option values in the dialogue are those set through the preferences' window - accessed by "Preferences" button. Changes to the options done through utility invocation dialogue aren't preserved; subsequent invocation of the same utility will again take the options from the last saved preferences
- When the application starts, it reads preferences' values from the file TODO located in the current user's home directory; if this file is nonexistent, hardcoded preferences are used; the file is written upon hitting OK button in the Preferences window
- Pressing OK in the utility dialogue starts the current utility; the GUI stays unresponsive until the utility finishes, status indicator shows "...Working..." (as opposed to "...Idle...")
- Log box at the bottom of the main application window houses diagnostic messages; those that indicate problems are underlined; the last message an utility prints tells how many problems it encountered; if the number is zero, there's no need to review the log

The workflow
============
1) Put the inputs (left- and right sets of out-of-camera images) under a new workarea directory.
2) In order to determine time-difference between the two cameras, do a dry run of stereopair-matcher with any dummy value for time-difference. That run fails, but produces data files with image timestamps under the data/output directory of your workarea - times_left.txt and times_right.txt . Choose left- and right images that obviously form a stereopair, and subtract left timestamp from the right timestamp - this is the value expected for -time_diff parameter.
3) Run stereopair-matcher to rename your original images so that the new names indicate stereopairs to your stereo-photo editor (e.g. StereoPhotoMaker). Do it before RAW conversion, color correction or alike; any further processing is based on the new names.
4) Perform color-correction on one set of images, let's say the left one.
5) Assuming left- and right exposures are mostly similar, copy your color-correction choices from left-side images to their right-side peers.
If you are using a compatible RAW converter (see TODO: Recommended RAW Converters), you can run settings-copier to clone all the settings in one click.
Alternatively, with most RAW converters, you can copy-paste the processing settings individually for each pair.
At the end of this stage you are expected to have produced standard images for both left- and right sides
5) Use color-comparator to look for large discrepancies between color/brightness in a stereopair. Only small difference is fixable by StereoPhotoMaker, adjust the colors in your tool of choice beforehand, then rerun the color-comparator. Several iterations might be required.
6) Perform your usual stereopair processing - with StereoPhotoMaker or alike.
The outcome of this stage - ultimate stereopair images chosen for archival.
7) If you want to archive the original and intermediate files, remove from your workarea directories those not "utilized" by the ultimate stereopairs
Workarea-cleaner ("Hide Unused" button) does this job automatically by moving the image- and conversion-settings files unrelated to any of the ultimate stereopairs into the thrash/backup directory provided in "-backup_dir" option. The related-or-not decision is based on image ID(s) in the filename (for instance, dsc1234-8765.jpg has two IDs: 1234 and 8765). The "-backup_dir" option specifies the root directory for all the backups in your current workarea. Each press of the "Hide Unused" button creates a new subdirectory under it, and all files being hidden by the current backup action are placed under this subdirectory.

Undoing some things
===================
The application includes two kinds of "undo" actions - original-images' name restoration and unhiding of hidden/cleaned files
- Name restoration ("Restore Names" button) works by means of reversing the actions done by pair matcher. Under the hood there is a mapping between original image names and their stereopair-friendly targets produced by pair-matcher; only the names included there are restored. E.g. any raw-conversion outputs are ignored - those are not original files and they weren't renamed by the pair-matcher. And name restoration refuses to run when conversion-settings are present - to avoid possible mistreatment
- Unhiding of hidden files ("Unhide Unused" button) asks for a backup subdirectory and moves all files from under it to their original locations.
Name of a backup subdirectory contains its creation time and a keyword telling which action created this specific backup. There are two kinds of backups: "HideUnusedFiles" - results from workarea-cleaner, and "BackupSettingsFiles" - in case settings-copier overrides an conversion-settings file, it moves the old version there.
