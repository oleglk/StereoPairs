Installation of DualCam-Companion
==================================

Dependencies
=============
You need to download and install the following two applications/bundles in order to use DualCam-Companion:
1) TCL interpreter with Tk (GUI) support.
You need TCL version 8.5 or higher. There exist alernative implementations of the TCL interpreter.
- A full TCL installation is available from the TCL official site at www.tcl.tk; get it if you plan to use TCL for
something beyond running DualCam-Companion.
-	Standalone (single-file) TCL interpreter "freewrap" - at freewrap.sourceforge.net .
You need to rename freewrap.exe into any name you like in order to use it as a plain interpreter.

2) Imagemagick image-manipulation suite:	www.imagemagick.org
	(you need 16-bit version of Imagemagick, no matter static or dynamic). 
  Note that there is a portable version too - the one that doesn't require installation.


Setting up DualCam-Companion
============================
- Unpack the archive into the directory where you want to run it from.
- Edit the paths in "Stereopairs" shortcut:
    "<Full-path-of-TCL-interpreter>" "<Full-path-of-gui.tcl>"
    Example:
      "C:\Program Files (x86)\etcl\bin\etcl.exe" D:\Work\StereoPairs\StereoPairs_TCL\gui.tcl
- Edit Imagemagick directory path in "ext_tool_dirs.csv"
    Example:
      ###################################################
      # ext_tool_dirs.csv
      Environment-variable-name,Path
      _IM_DIR,C:/Program Files (x86)/ImageMagick-6.8.7-3
    Note 1: lines starting from # are comments; there are two non-comment lines in the example: header line and one data line.
    Note 2: in the data line, _IM_DIR is a hardcoded keyword; the user changes only directory path after ",".
- Now you are ready to run DualCam-Companion software.
