Installation of DualCam-Companion
==================================

Dependencies
=============
You need to download and install the following two applications/bundles in order to use DualCam-Companion:
1) TCL interpreter with Tk (GUI) support.
You need TCL version 8.5 or higher. There exist alernative implementations of the TCL interpreter.
- A full TCL installation is available from the TCL official site at www.tcl.tk; get it if you plan to use TCL for
something beyond running DualCam-Companion.
-	Standalone (single-file) TCL interpreter "freewrap" - at freewrap.sourceforge.net .
You need to rename freewrap.exe into any name you like in order to use it as a plain interpreter.

2) Imagemagick image-manipulation suite:	www.imagemagick.org
	(you need 16-bit version of Imagemagick, no matter static or dynamic). 
  Note that there is a portable version too - the one that doesn't require installation.
