A background on invoking DOS commands

Use the following in your batch file:

start cmd.exe /k "more-batch-commands-here"

or

start cmd.exe /c "more-batch-commands-here"

    /c Carries out the command specified by string and then terminates
    /k Carries out the command specified by string but remains

Consult the cmd.exe documentation using cmd /? for more details.

The proper formating of the command string gets a little more complicated with spaces in the arguments. See the examples below. Note the use of nested double quotes in some examples.

Examples:

Run a program and pass a filename parameter:
CMD /c write.exe c:\docs\sample.txt

Run a program and pass a long filename:
CMD /c write.exe "c:\sample documents\sample.txt"

Spaces in program path:
CMD /c ""c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Winword.exe""

Spaces in program path + parameters:
CMD /c ""c:\Program Files\demo.cmd"" Parameter1 Param2
CMD /k ""c:\batch files\demo.cmd" "Parameter 1 with space" "Parameter2 with space""

Launch demo1 and demo2:
CMD /c ""c:\Program Files\demo1.cmd" & "c:\Program Files\demo2.cmd""
